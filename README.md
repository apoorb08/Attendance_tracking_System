This is a simple **Attendance Tracking System** built using the C programming language. It reads student data from a CSV file (`students.csv`), allows attendance to be marked interactively via the terminal, and saves the updated records to `attendance.csv`.

## 🚀 Features

- Load student data from a CSV file
- View the list of students
- Mark students as present or absent by registration number
- View attendance summary (present vs absent count)
- Display individual student's attendance status
- Save attendance data to a new CSV file for future use

## 📂 File Structure

```
.
├── attendance.c        // Source code file
├── students.csv        // Input file with student names and registration numbers
└── attendance.csv      // Output file where attendance is recorded
```

## 📄 students.csv format

Each line should contain:
```
Name,RegistrationNumber
```

**Example:**
```
Alice Johnson,REG001
Bob Smith,REG002
Charlie Brown,REG003
```

## 📄 attendance.csv format

This file is automatically generated or updated and contains:
```
RegistrationNumber,Status
```

**Example:**
```
REG001,P
REG002,A
REG003,P
```

Where `P` = Present and `A` = Absent.

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the program**:
   ```bash
   gcc attendance.c -o attendance
   ```

2. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   ./attendance
   ```

## ✅ Usage Options

When you run the program, you will be presented with a menu:
```
1. Show Students List
2. Mark Attendance
3. Show Summary
4. Show Student Attendance
5. Exit
```

Choose the desired option and follow the prompts.

## 📌 Notes

- Students not marked manually will remain marked as **Absent**.
- You must create a valid `students.csv` before running the program.
- Attendance is saved automatically upon exiting.
